# riemannProblem
Implementation of solutions for the Riemann problem.

The purpose is create simple and usefull code associated to the Riemann problem to allow learning and experiments.

The python3 code is programmed using spyder3. The c is programmed using codeblocks.

To use it, run:
$ python3 ROE.py

This command is going to run the Roe solution, the characteristics solution and compare them.
